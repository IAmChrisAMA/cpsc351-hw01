		v1.0 - GM | For Linux Only.
		 Chris Nutter | CPSC351-04

Instructions:

	clang myshell.c -o myshell


Execution:

	./myshell


Information:

	Due to using Linux, certain programs were replaced to compromise.
	However, some were unchanged. 

		   notepad   -->  vim
		   path      -->  pwd
		   tasklist  -->  top
		   vol 	     -->  df
		   echo	     -->  echo
		   dir	     -->  dir


Other:

	Theoretically, any command could work assuming I allow it to work with my shell.
	Any extra arguments work no problem.

	When testing vim, you can exit by typing (without quotes):
		
		':q!'

	Here is a less technical document on how to use 'vim'. 
	https://www.linux.com/tutorials/vim-101-beginners-guide-vim/

	When testing top, you can exit by typing:
	
		'q'

	Here is another less technical document on how to use 'top'
	https://www.lifewire.com/linux-top-command-2201163

	The rest of the programs do not require exiting operations and should
	report back to myShell.
